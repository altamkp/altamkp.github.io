Howdy! ðŸ˜Ž

My name is Alex Tam (aka [altamkp](https://github.com/altamkp)) and I am from Hong Kong, China. I am a part-time indie game developer creating games and plugins with GodotðŸ‘¾.

My game dev journey started with an AR project with Unity back in University. I fell in loveðŸ’™ with programming and game dev in particular. From Unity to Godot, C# to C++, I learnt almost everything by myself.

I have made numerous crappy games along the way as shown below, but you can check out the polished ones that are in production or even published [here](games/games.md)!
